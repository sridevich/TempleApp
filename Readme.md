Temple Quest is an application that allows users to search temples in 
the United States. The purpose of Temple Quest is to provide a tool for 
users to search for temples, view details, and post their personal 
experiences. The app has profile pages for each temple, where information 
such as the address, phone number, and a map via Google Maps API are 
displayed. On each temple page, users can also rate the temple services 
and post comments. In addition, the user can choose to save the temple. 
On the user's profile page, users can see the links to the temple pages 
they saved. Users can also see the ratings and comments that they left 
for temples. In a later phase, Temple Quest's search capabilities will 
be expanded to all places of worship.
